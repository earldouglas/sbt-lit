# Strings

This file contains static strings to be used within the application.
Note how we can mix Scala code in HelloWorld.md with Java code here.

This code lives in the `example.data` package:

```java
package example.data;
```

The `Strings` object provides access to the static strings:

```java
public class Strings {
  public static String helloWorld = "Hello, world";
}
```
